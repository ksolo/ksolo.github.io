## Hello!
I'm Kevin, a software developer from the Midwest that enjoys music, hockey, and just
about anything with airplanes.

I'm hoping to start sharing my experiences here, specifically my thoughts and ideas
around different languages, frameworks, and development practices. I'll likely throw
in some articles about flying from time to time as well just for good measure.

Though I hope to provide content for everyone, things will likely start of on topics
I am currently diving into, which are Solidity, compilers, and tech education.

If you have any questions about the content on this site, please feel free to reach me on:
