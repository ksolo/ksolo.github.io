  Things I'm doing now

## This is what I'm up to these days...

#### Where I'm working
I'm now a consultant for [Test Double](https://testdouble.com). I joined the team there in
November of 2017 after closing the Dev Bootcamp in San Diego.

#### Classes I'm Taking
I recently found out about this 2 part course called
[Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](http://nand2tetris.org/). It is often referred
to as Nand 2 Tetris, and having completed the first part in December, I'm now starting
the second session. This is probably the most fun I have had programming in a long time. If you see
me anytime soon, I will likely tell you all about it. When I finish with part 2, I'll write up a
review.

#### What I'm Reading
I like to read a little bit of fiction most night before going to sleep. My
current book is [Sherlock Holmes: The Ulimate Collection](http://amzn.to/2DhW32i).
I read anywhere from 15 - 45 minutes before dozing off.

On the heavier side I'm reading
[Growing Object Oreiented Software, Guided by Tests](http://amzn.to/2EUPVgy)
to improve my overall testing and design strategies. The first part
of the book introduces the concepts, and the second part is written in a way that has
you following the development of a project. I hope to have this one wrapped up in 3 - 4 weeks.

#### What I'm Listening To
I recently found a podcast called [Coding Blocks](https://www.codingblocks.net/). It is a
podcast on software architecture from the perspective of the 3 hosts. I really enjoy it, and
highly recommend it.

I'm also listening to [Alan Turing: The Enigma](http://amzn.to/2EUvOiD) audiobook,
which so far has been a little slow. I'm currently around 5 hrs into the 27 hr journey, there
is still a lot of time for things to pick up.

#### This Blog...
I recently started blogging...as you can tell. Though it's just getting started. I hope to add 1
new post every other week. I think I'll stick to mostly programming topics, but will throw in
rants and other thoughts from time to time.
