# Brave and BAT are Great for Open Source
A few months ago I started using the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/) and
have now made it my default browser for all devices. If you are not familiar
with Brave, it is a browser that has made user privacy its number one feature.
The browser blocks ads and other third party tracking tools that are likely
following you around the web reporting back what site you visit, or loading
your last Amazon search results into the current page. With all the ads and
tracking scripts being blocked, you may also notice improved loading times.

Realizing that blocking ads could be harmful to publishers. Brave is proposing
a new way to pay for content. As an alternative to ads, what if publishers were
paid for how much time you spent on their site? That is the experiment going on
with Basic Attention Token.

Basic Attention Token or BAT is a cryptocurrency that will be distributed to
publishers based on how much of your total attention you spend on their site.
This token can then be exchanged for more traditional currency by the publishers,
giving them a way to get paid without using an invasive ad-network.

I opted-in to the experiment and put a $5/month budget
